Welcome to my development blog! This is where I'll be sharing thoughts on iOS development, Swift, and other tech topics that interest me.

As an iOS engineer at [Numan](https://www.numan.com), I work on making healthcare more accessible for men. When I'm not coding, you can find me dancing or bouldering around London.

Stay tuned for posts about:
- iOS development tips and tricks
- Swift language features
- Mobile architecture patterns
- Development tools and workflows
- And whatever else catches my interest!

Thanks for stopping by!
